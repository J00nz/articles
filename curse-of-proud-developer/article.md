The Curse of the Proud Developer - how bugs lead to team building
---

The sky was turning dark when I saw the first _Internal Server Error_ (code 500), it was 5PM in the winter's afternoon and we were close to the release deadline. My heart missed at least two beats while my mouse ran to the reload button: "It may be just a network error, I thought". But it wasn't.

That day I was working on an important server side piece of code and suddenly nothing was working anymore. No error messages, no logs. Nothing but an _code 505_. I went into panic.

Around me everyone was packing up to go home and I thought I could not bother them for an error I made on my code. I was ashamed: "what they'll think of me? I will certainly loose my credibility as good developer". That was my fear and the room seemed to close down all around me. I was choking!

It was the _Curse of the Proud Developer_ kicking in after a long day of coding.

So I started to debug my code from scratch. After a bit of generic checkpoints my strategy turned into commenting everything then uncomment line by line and test the program to work. A damn long and frustrating process until the code went blur before my eyes.

I remember I was almost sweating under the office lights, my sight narrowed down on my keyboard trying to ignore all the happy people around me, hoping for a miracle to happen. And then the miracle did happen.

"We are going to Paddy's, do you join us?" It was Johan asking me out to the local pub where we hang out with the team every Friday night. "Ehm, I'm kinda stuck with a damn bug, can't join right now", my voice was trembling so much I felt ashamed.

Johan came close my desk and we involved into a pair programming session to bug fixing, in few minutes also Vladimir and Maximilian joined us: it was the full team working together to solve a late _WTF_ before going to the pub cheering at the past week!

Eventually we addressed the problem and today nobody really remember who was to thank for the bug fix, it was a real team work, and it was successful. We really deserved that beer!

Since that _Black Friday_ I faced many other _WTF_ moments but I've never wasted another minute trying to get out of it on my own. What a relief, I will not panic nor choking anymore.

My team is here to help me as I'm here to help them and this is how we won the _Curse of the Proud Developer_!
